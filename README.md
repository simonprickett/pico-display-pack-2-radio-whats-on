You will need to add your wifi SSID and password to the `secrets.py` file.  Edit `secrets.py` and replace the template content with the correct values for your network:

```python
WIFI_SSID = "Your wifi network name..."
WIFI_PASSWORD = "Your wifi password..."
```

Hopefully you find this a useful little project and a good demonstration of how to get some data from a JSON endpoint on the internet, display it on the Display Pack 2 and react to button presses on the device.  If you get this running or use it as a start point for your own project I'd love to hear from you.  Reach out to me using one of the methods on my website's [contact me](https://simonprickett.dev/contact/) page.
